# Notre Dame d'Autan - Parish Website PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Full-stack parish website for "Notre Dame d'Autan" (Castanet-Tolosan, Saint-Orens area). Features public site with news, agenda, mass schedules, and a private CMS for content management.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, React-Quill, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor async driver)
- **Auth**: JWT-based admin authentication

## Core Requirements
1. Public website: Homepage, News, Agenda, Mass schedules, Parish info, Bell towers map
2. CMS Admin: CRUD for News, Events, Mass Times, Funerals, Letters
3. Location management with Google Maps links
4. Interactive bell towers map (Leaflet/OpenStreetMap)
5. Versioning system displayed in footer and CMS

## What's Been Implemented

### Public Site
- Homepage with hero, news section, upcoming events, welcome message
